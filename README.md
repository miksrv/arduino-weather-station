<!-- ABOUT OF PROJECT -->
## About of Project

The Arduino Weather Station is an advanced, automated weather monitoring system designed to collect, process, and display real-time environmental data. The weather station is built using an Arduino microcontroller to handle sensor input and transmit data to a backend server. This data is then made available through an API built on PHP, MySQL, and CodeIgniter, with a frontend developed using Next.js and Redux RTK.

![Arduino Weather Station](./docs/arduino-weather-station-1.jpg)

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Data Collection:** The weather station continuously monitors various atmospheric parameters using multiple sensors.
- **Historical Data Storage:** Weather data is stored in a database, allowing users to view and analyze past conditions over selected periods.
- **Remote Access:** A web-based interface allows users to access weather information from anywhere, displaying current readings and historical trends.
- **Data Visualization:** Users can view live graphs of parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and more, along with detailed statistics for selected time frames.
- **API Integration:** The backend provides an API for developers to access weather data for integration into external applications.

### Measured Parameters:
- Temperature
- Feels like temperature
- Humidity
- Dew point
- UV intensity
- Solar energy
- Solar radiation
- Wind speed and direction
- Atmospheric pressure
- Precipitation levels
- Cloud cover

The system is highly customizable, and additional sensors can be integrated to expand its functionality. This project demonstrates how microcontrollers, web development, and real-time data processing can be combined to create a fully functional, real-world application.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the Arduino Weather Station project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v20 or higher)
- **NPM** or **Yarn** (for frontend dependencies)
- **PHP** (v8.0 or higher)
- **Composer** (for backend dependencies)
- **MySQL** (or any compatible database)
- **Arduino IDE** (for programming the Arduino microcontroller)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miksrv/arduino-weather-station.git
cd arduino-weather-station
```

### 2. Backend Setup (PHP + CodeIgniter)

1. Navigate to the `server` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and configure your environment variables, such as database connection settings:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Migrate the database:

   ```bash
   php spark migrate
   ```

5. Start the backend server (built-in PHP server or any web server of your choice):

   ```bash
   php spark migrate
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js + Redux)

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. To build the project for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Optionally, start the production build:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 4. Arduino Setup

1. Open the Arduino sketch from the `firmware` folder in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino microcontroller and upload the sketch.
3. Make sure the Arduino is correctly wired with the sensors.

### 5. Accessing the Application

Once the backend and frontend servers are running, access the weather station UI by visiting:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You can now monitor real-time and historical weather data from the Arduino Weather Station!

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

After successfully installing and setting up the Arduino Weather Station project, follow these steps to start using the application and monitor weather data.

### 1. Access the Web Interface

- Open your browser and navigate to the frontend running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the production URL if deployed).
- You will see a dashboard displaying current weather conditions as well as the option to view historical data.

### 2. Real-Time Weather Data

- The dashboard updates weather data in real-time, pulling data from the Arduino sensors connected to your weather station.
- Key metrics displayed include:
    - **Temperature**
    - **Humidity**
    - **Dew Point**
    - **UV Index**
    - **Wind Speed & Direction**
    - **Pressure**
    - **Precipitation**
    - **Solar Radiation**

### 3. Historical Data

- Navigate to the **History** or **Statistics** page from the main menu.
- Choose a date range to view weather trends and archived data, including charts for various metrics like temperature, wind, and humidity.

<div align="center">

    ![Weather Station User Interface - History Page](./client/public/images/history.jpg)

</div>

### 4. Customize Data Display

- You can customize the data display to show or hide specific sensors on the dashboard.
- For example, toggle between temperature readings, feels-like temperature, and dew point, or switch between solar energy and solar radiation.

### 5. Arduino Sensor Calibration

- For accurate readings, you may need to calibrate some sensors depending on your specific environment. Refer to the Arduino sketch in the `arduino/` folder to adjust the calibration values for sensors such as temperature or pressure.

### 6. Data Export

- Weather data can be exported from the **Statistics** page in various formats (e.g., CSV) to analyze trends further.

### 7. System Maintenance

- The backend server running on PHP + CodeIgniter is responsible for handling incoming data from the Arduino sensors and storing it in a MySQL database. Ensure the backend is running to avoid data loss.
- The frontend is built with Next.js and provides a smooth interface to view, interact with, and analyze weather data.

### 8. Arduino Weather Station Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor real-time weather conditions using connected sensors.
- **Historical Data**: Review weather history with customizable date ranges.
- **Graphical Visualizations**: View weather trends and patterns using interactive charts.
- **Sensor Readings**: Monitor multiple environmental factors, such as UV Index, wind speed, and solar radiation.
